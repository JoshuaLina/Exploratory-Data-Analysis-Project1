# Exploratory Data Analysis Project 1
## Dataset: Electric Power Consumption
## Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Di??erent
electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available. 
## Therare 9 variables in this dataset
1. Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
2. Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
3. Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
4. Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
5. Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
6. Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
7. Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a
microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
8. Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a
tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
9. Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
## The dataset has 2,075,259 rows.
## Our overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. Your task is to reconstruct the
following plots below, all of which were constructed using the base plotting system.
## Four R-code were created, Plot1.R (FIGURE 1), Plot2.R (FIGURE 2), Plot3.R (FIGURE 3), Plot4.R (FIGURE 4).
## Each figure was constructed as a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels. after the figure was created
## The R-code close the PNG divice
